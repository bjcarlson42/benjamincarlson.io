## Introduction

React hooks allow you to perform side effects in function components. In this post, we will take a look at ```useEffect``` and give examples
of how to use in in [next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Using useEffect In Next.JS

Let's take a look at an example. We will use ```useEffect``` to add an event listener
to handle when a user scrolls. We will then log to the console the scrollY value. This is how this website dynamically adds
the css to the nav bar on scroll!

First, we will import ```useEffect``` from react.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
```

Next, call the method:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
        
    })
```

We can add anything we want in here. Let's add our event listeners:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
        window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
        return () => {
            window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll)
        }
    })
```

Finally, create the handle scroll method and log the scrollY value to the console:

```javascript
const handleScroll = () => {
        console.log(scrollY)
    }
```
